              <p class="card-text">An oscilloscope is a useful peice of equipment used to visuluse waves to be able to take measurements.
                They work via an electron gun one end emitting a beam of electrons towards a fluorescent screen.
                Light is emitted from the spot on the screen where the beam hits.
                There are two axis on an oscilloscope..</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Y-axis</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The first of the two axis is the y-axis which is highlited in the above image.
                This controls the scale on the y-axis. At the moment it is pointing to 5 Volts per cm. This means that every horizontal line represents 5 Volts.
                This can be changed so the scale is something reasonable for the signal coming in.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">X-axis</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The other axis (which is also highlighted in the image above) is the x-axis. This controls the time scale on the oscilloscope.
                This makes the otherwise stationarry spot move accress the screen at a constant speed. The x-scale is usually calibarted in milliseconds or microseconds per cm.

        <li class="list-group-item">The grid on an ocilloscope is marking with a centimetre grid.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">To measure the peak p.d., you have to observe the waveform heihg from the bottom to the stop of the wave (e.g. 5cm). From this we can get the amplitude (5/2 = 2.5cm). Observe what the y-gain is set to (e.g. 3Vcm^-1). The peak p.d. is therefore 3*2.5 = 7.5V</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">To measue the frequency of the alternating p.d., we need to measure the time period (T) which is time form one full wave cycle to pass. Then we can calculate the frequency as the inverse of the time period.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">You can also measure the speed of ultrasound with an oscilloscope. The time base circuit of an oscilloscope can be used to trigger an ultrasonic transmitter so it sends out short pulses of ultrasonice waves. If the receiver signal is applied to the y-input of the oscilloscope, the waveform of the received pulse can be seen on the screen as a wave. To find the time, you measure the hoizontal sitance from the left to the leading edge of the pulse and the multiply this by the time base setting. You can then use speed = distance/time to calculate the speed of the ultrasonic waves.</li>
